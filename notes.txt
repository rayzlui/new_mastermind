Things to do:

proofread documentation //Do Thursday, May 4th

write test for most views and reducers. //Do Thursday, Math 5th

add pokeapi for sprites?
  - add this in css or javascript?
  - if javascript use inline styling from javascript and have obj storing sprites

add giphy api to background?

create VERSUS MODE 

-two players playing vs computer
-two rounds each, if draw after two rounds, first to lose, loses. just use timed mode for this, winner is higher score after a certain time.
-use timed mode here too
-classic mode ? => how many turns it took for each player to solve one code 
-timed mode? => keep score, winner has most in time.



maybe never gonna give you up each time they click?

maybe try and make it like those three match games
  - each time user inputs 1 correct, does 1 damage 
  - 2 == 2 damage 
  - heals each time you get wrong 
  - can't win until all correct?


MISC + ALREADY DONE BELOW:

add hints where if one clicks hint button, we auto add a correct num into a user board?
  - highlight userboard spot red to signify hinted
  - or add to move history. 


//states
this.state = {
  gameMode: 'computer',
  remainingTurns: 10,
  correctAnswer: null,
  moveHistory: [],
  selectedInput: undefined,
  userBoard: {1: null, 2: null, 3: null, 4:null},
  numsSelected: 0,
  winner: false,
}



//from homescreen

import store from '../createStore'

store.dispatch({type: VERSUS_COMPUTER})

import { VERSUS_COMPUTER } from '../actions/actionTypes'



seperate timed mode and classic mode.
  - time mode will be solve as many as you can in time given.
  - classic will be turn based.


allow player to select if they want to replay with same difficulties or change

add highlight to selected index when they click on it so they know where entering code into.


a bunch of css.
  - common styling
  - make colored pegs



unincorporated ideas:

THIS FEELS REDUNDANT. They are exactly the same thing, you have a certain amount of time to complete it. Except "timed" mode will score it.
add turns into timed mode, so they'll lose score points if they don't get it right? 
add time into classic mode
call those challenge modes?
  - need to add challenge into state 
  - easy in timed, just track turns left, update score and trigger new code generator
  - classic reimplment how it was previously built.
