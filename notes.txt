Things to do:
seperate timed mode and classic mode.
  - time mode will be solve as many as you can in time given.
  - classic will be turn based.


create VERSUS MODE 

-two players playing vs computer
-two rounds each, if draw after two rounds, first to lose, loses.

or use timed mode here too

allow player to select if they want to replay with same difficulties or change

a bunch of css.
  - common styling
  - add highlight border to selected index

add giphy api to background?
add pokepai for sprites?
maybe never gonna give you up each time they click?
add hints where if one clicks hint button, we auto add a correct num into a user board?
  - highlight userboard spot red to signify hinted

maybe try and make it like those three match games
  - each time user inputs 1 correct, does 1 damage 
  - 2 == 2 damage 
  - heals each time you get wrong 
  - can't win until all correct?
